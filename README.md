# Heterogeneous-OpenCL-Image-Processing-Engine
The goal is to demonstrate how heterogeneous hardware can be efficiently combined to accelerate data-parallel tasks, analyze how well the implementation adapts to new platforms or transformations, and provide a clear performance characterization of CPU, GPU, and cooperative execution.
